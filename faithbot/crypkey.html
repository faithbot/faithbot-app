					<h1>CrypKey Software Inc. Web Development and Design</h1>
				</div>
				<h2>The Project</h2>
				<p>Crypkey is a company that provides copy protection software and licensing systems. They wanted a new website highly optimized for SEO and with a modern look.</p>

				<h2>The Process</h2>
				<p>I created the new CrypKey website from the ground up, from wireframes and mockups, to the design and development. I worked with CrypKey to organize pages and create a cool, high-tech style, and made the entire site mobile friendly.</p>

				<h3>Designing a Site From Scratch</h3>
				<p>I designed an entirely new website, using inspiration from the existing bright colors of the old site, but toning them down with more sophisticated blacks and greys.</p>
				<p>I decided on a "text carousel" as the main focus of the homepage. The idea was to have a visually interesting area with the key calls-to action in strong prominence, without the distraction of the typical image-styled carousels. The carousel featured 3 strong marketing phrases with two stationary buttons to the trial versions of the two main products.</p>

					<p>The "wireframe" shows the basic layout concept, before colors and images are chosen. A mobile one was also made to show how the layout could flex to accommodate smaller screens.</p>

				<h3>The dual-product line solution</h3>
				<p>The company was branching into a new product line, and needed an area to promote it that remained separate from the main product pages, but retained a unified feel. The new product line was a "mirror" version of the original design, featuring a similar layout but different colors to differentiate the two. A large link at the top of the page helped direct users to the other product line.</p>

				<h2>Marketing and Adwords</h2>
				<p>One of the main priorities of the new website was to create excellent organic search and AdWords optimization</p>

				<h3>AdWords</h3>
				<p>The company relied heavily on Google AdWords to attract new customers. I became familiar with the entire AdWords interface and used techniques to not only improve click rates, but also increase the quality of the clicks. Some of the techniques I used include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Writing Quality Ads</strong>
						I wrote many Ads tailored to match keywords and headings of specific pages. Because the relevancy of the Ads was improved, the cost ratio of the clicks was lowered. Meaning, more clicks with lower costs per click.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Monitoring bid settings</strong>
						I used a simple spreadsheet to update bid amounts strategically. Checking the bids daily at first, and then weekly, I was able to create the perfect balance of bid amounts that allowed for high rankings, but did not overwhelm the budget early. This resulted in no more stopping of ads mid-day, and most important ads remaining in high ranking spots without costing more than necessary.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Adding Negative Keywords</strong>
						Because the company featured a very specific product tailored to a small industry, it was important to reduce the amount of clicks from unrelated search terms. I used the real search term data to create a list of non-specific negative keywords. This had a huge impact on the number of "wasted clicks". Users searching for unrelated terms no longer would see the ads. While the amount of clicks went down, the amount of quality clicks was actually raised, and the better relevancy of the ads meant improved rankings for search terms that <i>were</i> related.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Targeting and Un-targeting clicks by location</strong>
						I used the Google analytics tools to better target locations where the ads would have more effect. Locations where the product was not likely to be sold, such as China and Russia were filtered out, while the common locations of existing and likely potential users were targeted more specifically.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>SEO</h3>
				<p>The previous website was affected by a major Google search algorithm update, and so the new site had to include all of the most modern SEO best practices. Some of the considerations I put into the new site include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Optimized page load time</strong>
						The site was built in a simple but highly effective manner, with optimized images, lightweight code, and no external CSM system. The page load time increased significantly.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Optimized page structure</strong>
						The site was built using the more modern page structure of HTML5. Heading tags were matched carefully to the content and also to the page titles and Google Adwords. The more relevant page structure allows for better indexing of the site and correct keyword targeting.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Optimized page content</strong>
						My work on the site involved writing new and more fleshed-out content to give the keywords more relevance on the page and provide better value to users.
					</li>
				</ul>
